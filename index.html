      <h2>How to play</h2>
      This game is heavily inspired from
      <a href="https://www.pokedoku.com/">PokeDoku</a>
      and it functions almost the same. You have to fill in a pokemon that fits
      the categories indicated by the row and column headers. <br />
      However, there is one <strong>major</strong> twist. The goal of the game
      is to get the pokemon that has the <strong>highest value</strong> in a
      specific stat. For example, in PokeFatso, you have to get the pokemon with
      the highest weight.<br />
      More info on each of the categories and win conditions can be found on the
      <a href="gamechooser.html">game chooser</a> page. To see all the pokemon
      that fit a category check the
      <a href="pokemonlist.html">pokemon list</a> page.

      <h2>About this site</h2>
      As mentioned previously, I took a lot of inspiration from PokeDoku and you
      should definitely check them out. <br />
      I wanted to expand the original PokeDoku game and add more categories and
      win conditions. <br />
      All the data taken from this site is from the
      <a href="https://pokeapi.co">RESTful Pokemon API</a> so a big thanks to
      them. The data from the api is not perfect so if there are any errors
      please reach out to me.
